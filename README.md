PuzzleNode #13 - Chess Validator
===

Here is my solution to the PuzzleNode #13: http://puzzlenode.com/puzzles/22. It has been tested with Ruby 1.9.3 and Rspec 2

To run the validator, execute the following command from your terminal:

  $ ruby chess.rb

It will create a file named complex_results.txt in the root of the project.
